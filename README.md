Chroma-X
--------

  This is a vertical shoot-em-up written using C++, SDL and Code::Blocks for the
  GP2X.  It was created for one of the PDRoms coding competitions, but was not
  entered as it is unfinished.

Requirements
------------

  You need a GP2X to run this game.  It was designed using the F-200 version.
  It should work on the F-100 GP2X, but the controls probably won't work as well
  with the mini joystick.


Installation
------------

  Copy this folder to your GP2X's SD card.
